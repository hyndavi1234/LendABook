# LendABook
Lend-A-Book is a web application that offers a uniform platform for lenders and borrowers to exchange books. This application encourages the cost-effective practice of book reusability. The users may purchase, sell, or even rent books for a few days at a reasonable price.

This web application will benefit those who want to read many books without worrying about storing them or those seeking a cost-effective choice. In addition, this application would also include academic-related books, which help the majority of students. 

There is a need for an application for lending or borrowing books since people purchase books and may only use them for a short period. This application allows users to make money by renting books to others. In addition, the customer may only spend a small amount of money on books they will only read for a few days.
